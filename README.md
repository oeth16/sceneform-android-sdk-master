An Augmented Reality Android Application For Interaction with Sound Zones
====================================
This repository contains the code developed the master's thesis project. The source code can be imported into Android Studio, the selected module for running the application should be set to "sound_zones". 

Inside the folder "APK" an Android Application Package(APK) can be found. Transfer this file to an Android phone and open the file to install the application. It might need permissions to install APKs from 3rd party publishers. If the required dependencies are not installed when launching the application, then Google Play Store will automatically open and allow installation of the needed dependencies(Usually this is only Google Play Services for AR)
